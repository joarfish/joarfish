## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer focussing on real-time 3D graphics on the web and native. Professionally I mainly work, with Three.Js / WebGL and React but have a great interest in WebGPU, Rust, and C++.

### Some prototypes and personal projects

- [Compute-shader based 3D CFD simulation in godot](https://github.com/joarfish/godot_force_field)
- Chrome extension for investigating Three.Js scenes: [Threespector](https://github.com/joarfish/threespector)
- [Bevy Orbit Controls](https://github.com/joarfish/bevy_orbit_controls)
- Simple prototype of bringing node based workflows to 2D vector graphics: [Hardeen](https://github.com/joarfish/hardeen)
- webgpu-rs based [renderer](https://github.com/joarfish/cells)
